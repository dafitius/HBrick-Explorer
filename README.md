# Hbrick Explorer

## Introduction

Hbrick Explorer, formerly known as "TBLU Viewer" represents a milestone in the history of Hitman modding. This Java-based tool was among the first to venture into the uncharted territory of dissecting and understanding Hitman's TBLU and TEMP files. While it has since been succeeded by more complete and user-friendly tools, this repository still stands as an archival reference.

If you wish to view, edit or create Brick (TBLU and TEMP) files then I highly recommend searching for the latest tools on the modding community's [wiki site](https://glaciermodding.org/docs/)

## Features

Hbrick Explorer offers insights into the structure of Hitman's TBLU and TEMP files

Hbrick Explorer decodes TBLU and TEMP files, providing insights into their structure. It supports individual and combined decoding of the TBLU and TEMP files.

Explore the file structure through an intuitive tree-based view.

Hbrick Explorer provides a basic yet functional interface for exploring TBLU and TEMP files:

1. Edit the `settings.txt` file (optional)

2. Launch the application by executing the Java application (.jar) file. Make sure to install the JRE 8 if you don't have it installed.

3. Use the application's import button to open a TBLU and/or TEMP file(s) that you wish to explore.

4. Explore the file's contents. You can navigate through the tree structure and select specific elements for inspection.
